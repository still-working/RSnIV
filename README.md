SOC Project

We learned Python and Statistics in Week1.
  In Python, I was introduced to various packages like numpy, matplotlib, pandas and seaborn.
  In Statistics, I learned about various kinds of graphs and distributions, followed by various tools which could help to easily understand and manage data.
  Next, we even completed a task given to us.
  
In Week2 we learned about further tools used in Statistics, and I was introduced to Machine Learning.
  Next, we were started to learn CNN and basic understanding of Neural Network.
  
In Week 3 and 4, we further continued with CS231n regarding Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.
  Moreover, WE went through a research paper regarding the concepts of deep learning, CNN architectures, challenges, applications and future direction.
